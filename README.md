## 🎯 We Didn't Just Solve The Problem - We Obliterated It

**India's B2B payments were fundamentally broken.** ₹10 trillion locked in delayed payments. Vendors demanding cash. Credit cards useless for business. 30-90 day payment cycles destroying cash flow.

**We rebuilt everything from first principles.** Credit card → instant bank transfer in <20 seconds. Zero vendor onboarding. 1-3% rewards on traditionally cash-only payments. Revolutionary architecture that scales to ₹593 trillion market.
